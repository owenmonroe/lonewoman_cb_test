Hardacre1880_SM,journal-article,"Emma C. Hardacre,","""Eighteen Years Alone: A Tale of the Pacific,""",Eighteen Years Alone A Tale of the Pacific,<i>Scribner's Monthly</i>,"20,",no. 5,,May,1880,1880-05-01,657-64,,,,,"New York, New York",Public domain,,,,,,"Emma Chamberlain Hardacre’s lengthy magazine article ""Eighteen Years Alone"" has played perhaps the most significant role in shaping public ideas about the Lone Woman, in part by influencing Scott O’Dell’s imagining of the fictional Karana.  First published in <i>Scribner’s Monthly</i> in 1880, the article was rapidly reprinted in other publications and also widely quoted in articles that soon crossed the United States.  In 1950, the article was republished in booklet form for a local California audience, and this version was prefaced by remarks from Hardacre’s niece, Elizabeth Mason.  Beginning in the early 1960s, when academic interest in the Lone Woman blossomed, Hardacre’s article was reprinted by anthropologists Robert F. Heizer and his colleagues in both <i>Reports of the University of California Archaeological Survey</i> no. 55 and <i>The California Indians: A Source Book</i>, both of which went through multiple editions.

Emma Hardacre was a journalist who traveled widely and wrote for a number of newspapers in the Midwest and East, including the <i>New York Herald</i>, <i>Chicago Times</i>, and <i>Louisville-Courier Journal</i>.  She arrived in Santa Barbara in the 1870s and was asked by locals associated with the Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History to write a story about the Lone Woman; in doing so, she interviewed men who had been involved in searching for and transporting the Lone Woman from San Nicolas Island to Santa Barbara, including George Nidever, Carl Dittman, and Thomas Jeffries.<sup>1</sup>  Hardacre, then, had access to first-hand accounts about the Lone Woman.  But she also followed journalistic conventions of her day: sensationalism was an accepted norm, and storytelling and drama were highly valued in journalistic pieces.<sup>2</sup>  One might say that the most defining characteristic of Hardacre’s ""Eighteen Years Alone"" is the degree to which it is characterized by literary tropes.

Hardacre’s account of the Lone Woman begins by invoking two tropes that by 1880 had already been well-established in journalistic accounts about the Nicoleña: that of the island native as a female Robinson Crusoe and the ""fact"" that the woman leapt overboard (she ""voluntarily breasted the waves, and fought death"") in order to be reunited with a child left behind on the island.  In great detail, the article continues to develop the image of the Lone Woman as a Noble Savage.  The island native had fair skin and neat manners, Hardacre reports, and she was motivated to sacrifice everything for the sake of her child.  As a Noble Savage, however, the Lone Woman’s proper environment was the wilds of San Nicolas Island.  When she was brought to Santa Barbara, California, by American hunters, she quickly ""drooped under civilization.""

In telling the entire tragic narrative of the Lone Woman and her people from the 1814 massacre brought about by Russian and Alaska Native sea otter hunters to the 1835 removal of the community to San Pedro to the 1853 removal of the Lone Woman to Santa Barbara, Hardacre touches on nearly every trope apparent in the Lone Woman archive.  By contrast to the Nicoleños, who Hardacre represents as Noble Savages, the Alaska Natives are described as merely savages, slaughtering the Nicoleño men and enacting sexual violence on the Nicoleño women.  

In Hardacre’s telling, those San Nicolas Islanders who survived the tragedies of 1814 were removed to mainland California for their safekeeping, but like the Lone Woman who would later follow them, they quickly ""vanished,"" incapable of flourishing in a ""civilized"" world so foreign from their own.  For both the American sea otter hunters intimately involved in the narrative (the ""discoverers"" of the Lone Woman) and for readers of Hardacre’s tale, San Nicolas Island and its people evoked a sense of wonder.  The awed disbelief the Nicoleños’ story invites echoes the sense of wonder experienced by armchair travelers to the New World during the Age of Discovery.

Hardacre’s narration of the Lone Woman’s story was immensely compelling to nineteenth-century readers, and it spawned numerous other accounts of the California Indian woman’s eighteen years alone.

Dittman.",,,"Carl Dittman’s personal narrative, including his role in locating and transporting the Lone Woman to mainland California, has long been overshadowed by George Nidever’s.  As captain of the fateful 1853 expedition to San Nicolas that resulted in the Lone Woman’s removal to mainland California, the fifty-year-old Nidever outranked the significantly younger Dittman, who on this journey was merely a member of the crew.  Moreover, it was Nidever and his wife, not Dittman, who housed the island woman once the hunting party returned to Santa Barbara with the Lone Woman in tow.  

George Nidever also had better press.  In 1928, the Daughters of the American Revolution erected a plaque at the Santa Barbara Mission commemorating the discovery and rescue of the Lone Woman.  The historical marker, which is still standing, gives Captain George Nidever sole credit.  And in 1937, the University of California Press published Nidever’s <i>Life and Adventures</i>, a narrative that at 165 hand-written pages dwarfs Dittman’s 48-page dictation, still unpublished to this day.  The two men’s differing relationships to the United States as a nation may be another factor in their subsequent memorialization.  George Nidever was a native-born American whose parents were also native born (his father from Pennsylvania, his mother from Virginia).  Nidever’s journey to California follows the typical east to west pattern of American expansion and accompanying concept of Manifest Destiny.  After a childhood in Tennessee, North Carolina, and Missouri, Nidever began a series of travels that progressively moved him west to Mexican California.  Here, he participated in the Mexican-American War, fighting alongside John C. Frémont and accompanying the Lieutenant-Colonel to Cahuenga, where articles of capitulation were signed.  (The Treaty of Cahuenga preceded the Treaty of Guadulupe Hidalgo, which officially ended hostilities between the United States and Mexico and resulted in the United States gaining northern California and land including present-day Arizona and New Mexico, as well as portions of Utah, Nevada, and Colorado.)  Nidever therefore directly contributed to the expansion of U.S. territory. 

Frontier or borderland spaces such as the nineteenth-century American west ease barriers to mobility presented by race, class, and gender, but they never erase them entirely.  Unlike Nidever, Carl Dittman was foreign-born, arriving in Santa Barbara, California in 1844 as a citizen of Prussia.  Dittman took to the sea as an adolescent, escaping an unhappy apprenticeship, according to family stories.<sup>1</sup>  After several years as a seaman, Dittman settled in Mexican California, where he engaged in a variety of jobs including managing a storehouse, farming, mining for gold, and especially, sea otter hunting.  Dittman was often known as Charley Brown, and the confusion over his name points to his ""foreignness.""  As he dictated to Edward Murray, ""My right name is Carl Dittman although I am generally called Charley Brown, having adopted this latter name while I was a sailor.  My native place is Ueckamünde, about 30 miles from Berlin, Prussia.  I went to sea while still a boy, making my first voyage with Capt. Ratman who belonged in my town.""  

As Mexico and the United States struggled for control of California, Dittman’s foreign citizenship was at times a benefit.  During an 1846 sea otter hunting expedition, for example, Dittman traveled with a Scot (Bill Fife), two Americans (George Nidever and [Reading] McCoy), and ""Mission indians [sic] from various Missions.""  When the group reached Santa Barbara, they were met by six Californios who arrested them, as the Mexican-American War had begun.  According to Dittman’s narrative, only he and Fife, the non-Americans, were released.  

But while foreign citizenship might be desirable when California’s future was uncertain, it was less so once California was incorporated into the United States.  In March 1849 and again in the spring of 1850, Dittman mined for gold at the Stanislaus diggings.  He doesn’t discuss taxes in his narrative, but during this period, a ""foreign miners’ tax"" was levied against non-U.S. fortune seekers.  Well after his contact with the Lone Woman, Dittman began the process of seeking U.S. citizenship.  He submitted a Letter of Intent for naturalization on 20 July 1867, and on 31 July 1871, his citizenship was granted in the Court of the First Judicial District in Santa Barbara. <sup>2</sup>  During this period, the wife and children (under age 21) of a naturalized man gained U.S. citizenship automatically.

Dittman’s <i>Narrative</i> mentions neither his naturalization nor a wife and children.  Other records, however, indicate that Dittman established a family (marriage is uncertain) with Francisca Cascareña, who was born at Mission San Luis Rey, in Alta California, around 1825.  Francisca was likely a Payómkawichum (Lusiña or Luiseña), a Mission Indian.  Although she was born after Mexican independence, the Spanish missions underwent a long, uneven process of secularization.  Church, census, and court records indicate that Carl Dittman and Francisca Cascareña had two children, Maria Juana (later Mary) and Charles.  In 1861, Charles Dittman declared himself the legal father of these children, born of an Indian woman. <sup>3</sup>

As a naturalized citizen who married a Mission Indian, Carl Dittman lacked some of Nidever’s trappings as American pioneer for those interested in creating mythic narratives of the United States at the end of the nineteenth century.  This may explain his muted appearance in early accounts of the Lone Woman.

Along with Carl Dittman (also known as ""Charley Brown""), George Nidever was a central figure in the 1853 party of white men and ""Mission Indians"" (likely Chumash and/or Gabrielino men) that ultimately brought the Lone Woman to the California mainland. After the ship’s return to Santa Barbara, the Lone Woman stayed in the home of Nidever and his wife, Maria Sinforosa Ramona Sanchez de Nidever, until her death seven weeks later. Nidever, then, is an eyewitness to the Lone Woman’s habitation on San Nicolas Island, release from solitude, and life and death in Santa Barbara.

Because he was the ship owner and captain of the 1853 sea otter hunting crew, and because he later hosted the Lone Woman in his home, Nidever has generally been credited with the Lone Woman’s ""discovery"" and ""rescue.""  When the Santa Barbara chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution erected a plaque on the site of the Lone Woman’s presumed burial at the Santa Barbara Mission, for example, it was inscribed: ""Juana Maria/ Indian woman abandoned on/ San Nicolas Island eighteen years/ found and brought to/ Santa Barbara/ by/ Capt. George Nidever/ in 1853.""  In fact, however, it was Dittman who first saw and interacted with the woman. Regardless, Nidever and Dittman’s recorded recollections of the party’s initial encounter with the Lone Woman are similar. 

In the last quarter of the nineteenth century, historian Hubert Howe Bancroft (for whom the University of California’s library is named) hired a number of research assistants to interview and take dictations from leading California figures. Both Nidever and Dittman contributed to this project by telling their life stories to Edward F. Murray in 1878, twenty-five years after the Lone Woman’s removal from San Nicolas. Nidever’s memoir was later published in a popular volume, <i>The Life and Adventures of George Nidever: The Life Story of a Remarkable California Pioneer Told in his Own Words, and None Wasted</i> (1937).

<i>The Life and Adventures of George Nidever</i> not only provides an eyewitness account of the Lone Woman’s removal, albeit at a distance of a quarter century, but also offers contemporary readers insight into the California—and United States—that the Lone Woman entered. (Nidever relates the woman’s shock upon seeing an ox-cart and horses, for example, and reports that he received an offer, which he summarily refused, to display the Lone Woman in a side show, for profit). Importantly, however, the memoir <i>also</i> helps us to see—and reflect on— how Nidever made sense of the Lone Woman. He asserted that he understood her ""plainly;"" yet, from the distance of the twenty-first century, we can see how profound barriers of language, culture, and gender separated Nidever from the island woman.

Nidever was born in eastern Tennessee in1802 and moved steadily west during his lifetime as a hunter, trapper, and rancher who also engaged in gold mining, land speculation, and occasional Indian fighting. In short, Nidever was a consummate pioneer. Born two generations after Daniel Boone, however, his landscape was California rather than Kentucky. Nidever arrived in California in 1833, having traveled from Arkansas with a party of trappers.  Once on the west coast, he decided to remain in California, which was then part of Mexico (note the name of the woman he married: Maria Sinforosa Ramona Sanchez).  When California entered the union as the thirty-first state in 1850, Nidever became an ""original"" or ""native"" Californian.

Nidever and the Lone Woman’s paths crossed because Nidever’s economic activities regularly took him to the loosely-regulated California islands: he hunted otter, collected seagull eggs, and, on San Miguel, operated a sheep ranch.  Indigenous men frequently accompanied Nidever on these money-making expeditions, and the language Nidever employed in dictating his life story gives us clues as to the hierarchy involved in these relationships. Repeatedly, Nidever omits Native people’s names and uses possessive phrases such as ""my Indian"" to describe men with whom he worked, and on occasion, considered friends. The search party for the Lone Woman is a case in point: Nidever records that Charley Brown accompanied him on the trip, and in fact saw the Lone Woman first.  But he neglects to name the ""two Indians [who] went ashore"" with them. Their identities remain unrecorded today, although the ethnographic notes of J. P. Harrington suggest some possibilities (e.g., the Chumash men Malquiares and Policarpio and the Gabrielino Nolverto). In stark contrast, early twentieth-century historians ensured the production of a memoir that secures Nidever’s name, and story, for perpetuity. In a very real sense, then, Nidever’s history rests on the erasure of Native peoples’ history.

As <i>The Life and Adventures of George Nidever</i> records, Father González of the Santa Barbara Mission requested that Nidever and his hunting party search for the Lone Woman when on San Nicolas. Nidever went to some effort and expense to do so, as the journey to the most remote of the Channel Islands was more than 120 miles roundtrip in his schooner. It was on the third trip that Nidever finally succeeded. At that time, the Lone Woman had endured eighteen years of solitude; her ""rescuers"" don’t rush her to society, however. Rather, as Nidever reports, ""we remained here hunting about a month."" Their first goal, of course, was to make the expedition profitable.

Today, Nidever is recognized as a pioneer of California and is perhaps best known as the ""discoverer"" of the Lone Woman. In all his years hunting, tracking, and trapping, one could say that she was his ""biggest catch.""",

DailyAltaCalifornia1853,newspaper-article,,"""Female Robinson Crusoe—The Ladies' Fair,""",Female Robinson Crusoe—The Ladies Fair,<i>San Francisco Daily Alta California</i>,"4,",no. 295,13,November,1853,1853-11-13,2,E. Gilbert,,,,"San Francisco, California",Public domain,,,,,,"Published in San Francisco less than a month after the Lone Woman’s death in Santa Barbara, this article relates the story of the Lone Woman’s life and ""discovery"" by sea otter hunter George Nidever.  It then mentions two artifacts, a ""dress of bird skins"" and a wicker bottle, both of which will be exhibited at a Ladies Fair organized to raise funds for the city’s first cathedral.  The article describes the items of the Lone Woman’s manufacture as ""curiosities,"" conveying a sense of wonder that a woman could ""make anything so perfect"" with what the writer perceived to be limited tools.  The article’s headline associates the Lone Woman with Robinson Crusoe and the closing paragraph suggests that, due to the influence of George Nidever’s wife, the Lone Woman herself sought Christian conversion before dying. 
 
This article is important in part for its documentation of the Lone Woman’s cormorant garment, which subsequently was lost.  The dress was reputedly sent to the Vatican, evidence of the success of the Church’s ""civilizing"" project, but it has not yet been found.  The water bottle basket, later housed in the California Academy of Sciences, was destroyed in the San Francisco earthquake and fire of 1906.
 
After appearing in the <i>Daily Alta California</i>, this article of local interest—it discusses an upcoming Ladies Fair—served as a source for an article published the next day in a rival San Francisco newspaper, the <i>San Francisco Daily Placer Times and Transcript</i>. The day after that, however, the <i>Sacramento Daily Union</i> adapted the story, dropping local information about the Ladies Fair and simply retelling the narrative of the Lone Woman’s ""discovery"" and death.  When the Sacramento editors reprinted the article, they erroneously placed the Lone Woman’s death in San Francisco (their source for the story) instead of Santa Barbara.",

Brewer,,,,"Boston, Massachusetts",Public domain,,,,,,"The story of the Lone Woman’s isolation on San Nicolas Island was first published in a Boston newspaper, not a California one, and it appeared in 1847, years before the Nicoleña’s 1853 arrival in Santa Barbara.  News of the Lone Woman’s island isolation was undoubtedly carried to New England by the Boston men who figured prominently in the Northwest and China trades.  They likely heard the tale from fellow sailors while anchored in a California port, and they then brought the story home to New England.  In fact, we can see the story travel from California to Boston in the journal of William Dane Phelps.  A seaman born in Gloucester, MA, and living in Boston, Phelps kept elaborate journals at sea, in part for the entertainment of his wife (he sometimes sent journal pages home in advance of his return, by way of Boston-bound ships).  In May of 1841, Phelps recorded the story of the Lone Woman and her people, which he had heard from another captain (Thomas Robbins) on the California coast.  Phelps might not be the source for the <i>Boston Atlas</i> story, but his journal provides clues as to how the tale initially reached Boston.  

Once the Lone Woman’s story was told in a Boston paper, it appeared in New York the next day (a copy of the <i>Boston Atlas</i> likely having traveled south by train).  Within a month, the story had spread through the mails, reaching rural South Carolina by February and Wisconsin by March, for example.  Simultaneously, it continued to circulate in New England and New York.  Editors often held an interesting story in reserve, waiting for a column gap of the right length to insert the waiting copy.  Seven months after the ""A Female Crusoe"" initially appeared in the <i>Boston Atlas</i>, the story of the Lone Woman ""doubled the horn"" a second time; a direct reprint of the article appeared in the <i>Honolulu Polynesian</i>, likely carried to Hawaii in a newspaper taken aboard a ship outbound on the Pacific trade.  

The <i>Boston Atlas</i> article and its reprints is notable for linking the Lone Woman to Robinson Crusoe in its headline and for describing the Nicoleños as Noble Savages, a peaceful people who were taken off-guard by the arrival of Alaska Native hunters from Kodiak Island (which the article’s author erroneously dates to ""1818 or 1820,"" rather than 1814).  In the article’s telling, some years after the Alaska Native hunters leave the island, a ship is sent from the mainland to collect the remaining Nicoleños.  The Lone Woman boards the ship but takes a dramatic dive off of it, leaving behind a bereaved mate who will pine for her on the mainland for years to come.  The Lone Woman is described as voluntarily choosing to remain on her natal island, where she is an Indian Queen, ""the monarch of all she surveys.""  She wears a birdskin dress and flees when she encounters any hunters.",
