            <p>Several leagues off <placeName type="city" key="#ci_sb">Santa Barbara</placeName>, in

               population, at the South, as well as from the facts known to several Americans who

                     key="#re_local">the State</placeName></rs>; and the barter was carried on by
               means of shells, which was the principal medium of exchange between them. At the time

                  <placeName type="city" key="#ci_la">Los Angelos</placeName>,) with other
               Americans, had been in the habit of visiting <rs><placeName type="island" key="#i_sn"
                     >the island</placeName></rs>, while hunting otters, which abound in those
               waters.</p>
            <p>At one of these visits he brought away with him, on his departure, <rs><persName
                     type="nativeamerican" key="#Nicolenowoman7">a young Indian
                  squaw</persName></rs>. At this time there were about seventeen Indians living on
                     <rs><placeName type="island" key="#i_sn">the island</placeName></rs>. Shortly
               afterwards, <persName type="frontiersman" key="#iwi">Mr. Williams</persName>
               prevailed upon <persName type="seaman" key="#chu">Mr. Hubbard</persName>, who was
               captain of a small schooner, owned conjointly by <persName type="investor" key="#isp"
                  >Mr. Isaac Sparks</persName> (now of <placeName type="city" key="#ci_sb">Santa

                  type="city" key="#ci_mo">Monterey</placeName>, to bring over all <persName
                  type="group" key="#bhagroup">the Indians</persName> who remained. This was easily
               accomplished, as <persName type="group" key="#bhagroup">the Indians</persName> were
               desirous to remove.</p>
            <p>After they had all got on board <rs><name type="ship" key="#sh_peoresnada">the
                     schooner</name></rs>, <rs><persName type="nativeamerican" key="#lw">one of the
                     Indian women</persName></rs> discovered that <rs><persName
                     type="nativeamerican" key="#lwchild">her child</persName></rs> was missing, and
               asked permission to go on shore to look for it. This was at once granted. She
               remained a long time in the search, and at length made her appearance crying most
               bitterly. She said that she could not find <rs><persName type="nativeamerican"
                     key="#lwchild">her child</persName></rs>, and expressed her apprehension that
               it had been eaten by wild dogs, which it seems infest <rs><placeName type="island"
                     key="#i_sn">the island</placeName></rs>. She remained on the beach lamenting
               the loss of <rs><persName type="nativeamerican" key="#lwchild">her
                  child</persName></rs>; and whether through fatigue or excess of grief, she laid
               down and fell asleep.</p>
            <p>In the meantime it commenced to blow a gale of wind, and <rs><name type="ship"
                     key="#sh_peoresnada">the schooner</name></rs> put away, leaving her alone on
                     <rs><placeName type="island" key="#i_sn">this desert island</placeName></rs>. </p>
            <p>About three months afterwards, it is said, <rs><name type="ship" key="#sh_peoresnada"
                     >the schooner</name></rs> again touched at <rs><placeName type="island"
                     key="#i_sn">the island</placeName></rs> to bring her away, but she could not be
               found. Since that time her foot-prints have been occasionally seen on the shore, and
               other indications met with, showing that she still existed.</p>
            <p>At the beginning of the present month an American, <persName type="frontiersman"
                  key="#gni">George Niedever</persName>, who is now and has long been a resident of
                  <placeName type="city" key="#ci_sb">Santa Barbara</placeName>, was engaged in
               otter hunting off the coast, and touched at <placeName type="island" key="#i_sn">San
                  Nicholas</placeName>. While traveling along the beach to his great astonishment,
               he suddenly came upon <rs><persName type="nativeamerican" key="#lw">this
                     woman</persName></rs>. <span type="trope" n="1">She was engaged cleaning or
                  curing bird skins, which she sewed together to serve as a covering, and in a
                  garment made of which she was dressed. She did not manifest much surprise at
                  seeing <persName type="frontiersman" key="#gni">Mr. Niedever</persName>, but
                  readily assented to his proposition to leave <rs><placeName type="island"
                        key="#i_sn">the island</placeName></rs> and accompany him to <rs><name
                        type="ship" key="#sh_nidever">his schooner</name></rs>. She immediately set
                  about making preparations for her departure, and having packed up several bundles
                  of bird skins and other "fixings" which she had found serviceable in <placeName
                     type="island" key="#i_sn">San Nicholas</placeName>, she bade adieu forever to
                  the land where, for so long a time, she might have soliloquised with poetic

                  Indians</persName></rs> who could speak the language of one or two tribes of the
               California Indians. She was greatly delighted to see this Indian, but neither of them
               could understand a word of what the other said. She has a distinct articulation for
               almost every object she saw, but no one understands her unless when she uses signs
               and gestures. She is very contented and takes great delight in showing to her
               visitors as well as she can, how she dug the roots, caught the fish, manufactured her
               garments, and provided generally for her sustenance.</p>
            <p><span type="trope" n="10">She signifies that she is much better pleased with her
                  present mode of life than that she had on <rs><placeName type="island" key="#i_sn"

            <p>She takes great delight in looking at horses and cows, having probably never seen
               such large animals before. On one occasion she caught hold of a horse by the tail,
               and had it not been that <persName key="#sni">Mrs. Niedever</persName> called her
               away, she might probably have suffered severely for her ignorance.</p>
            <p>Among the articles she brought along with her from <rs><placeName type="island"
                     key="#i_sn">the island</placeName></rs> were several needles, with which she
               sewed the bird's skins together. These needles are beautifully made of fish bones,
               and show a superior degree of ingenuity. The thread which she used was the thin
               fibres of the sinews of a whale. She had also several fishing hooks made of old nails
               that she probably found in some boards picked up on the shore. These nails were well
               bent and sharpened, and attached to a line made of fibres of whale sinews beautifully
               twisted together. She had also among her moveables a soft clayey substance like
               brick, but whether she used this for dressing the bird's skins, or for simply giving
               a red color to her garments, no one could well make out. She had a knife also about
               an inch long, which seems to have been a piece of an iron hoop. It is set in a wooden
               handle. She brought with her some seal meat, but how she could eat this seems
               incomprehensible. Ten or twenty years is about as near as the olfactory nerves would
               permit any of our party to go to it. She had a quantity of roots which are generally
               known here by the Indian name of <emph>cometes</emph>. In taste they are like the
               kernel of an unripe nut.</p>
            <p><span type="trope" n="4">She is a strange specimen of <rs><orgName

            <p>I send you some of the roots which she used for food, also some of the fibres of the
               whale sinews, and two of the bird's skins out of which she made her garments, (and
               which, by the way, she wore with the feathery side inwards,) that you may show to any
               of your friends who may have the curiosity to look at them.</p>
