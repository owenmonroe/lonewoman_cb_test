            <p>As <rs><name type="ship" key="#sh_peoresnada">the last boat</name></rs> was leaving
               the strand, <rs><persName type="nativeamerican" key="#lw">a woman</persName></rs>
               with <rs><persName type="nativeamerican" key="#lwchild">a young babe</persName></rs>
               in her arms sprang on shore. <rs><persName type="nativeamerican" key="#lwchild">Her

               in the confusion&#8212;gone probably in search of some remembered trinket dear to her
               childish heart&#8212;or, perhaps, run away, overcome with terror at the unusual
               migration of <persName type="group" key="#bhagroup">her people</persName>.</p>
            <p><rs><persName type="nativeamerican" key="#lw">The woman</persName></rs> besought them
               to await her return, and hastened over the hill, calling as she went. The moments

               went by, but <rs><persName type="nativeamerican" key="#lw">the woman</persName></rs>
               had not returned. The wind was rising rapidly, and a storm was imminent. <rs><name

               twice in the last half hour. The waters about <rs><placeName type="island"
                     key="#i_sn">the island</placeName></rs> were shoal, and there was no safe
               anchorage along its shores. The waves were running high upon the ledges surrounding
               the little bay, and their crests were white with the foam of action. <rs><name
                     type="ship" key="#sh_peoresnada">The ship</name></rs> signaled again, and with
               a muttered imprecation and a gruff command, the boat pushed off to join <rs><name

            <p>As soon as all were on board, <persName type="seaman" key="#chu">Captain

                     <rs><persName type="nativeamerican" key="#lw">the woman</persName></rs> had
               been left behind, they besought <rs><persName type="seaman" key="#chu">the
                     captain</persName></rs> with many tears, and with pleadings in their own
               tongue, to return and bring her away.</p>
            <p>The gale increased in fury and continued unabated for the space of a week. <rs><name

               hard, and disaster threatened.</p>
            <p>When <placeName type="city" key="#ci_sp">San Pedro</placeName> Harbor was finally
               reached, the <persName type="group" key="#bhagroup">San Nicholas Indians</persName>

                  >Captain Hubbard</persName> departed for <placeName type="city" key="#ci_mo"
                  >Monterey</placeName>, where he had orders to take on a cargo of lumber for
                  <placeName type="city" key="#ci_sf">San Francisco</placeName>.</p>
            <p>On reaching <placeName type="region" key="#re_thegoldengate">the Golden

               Captain Hubbard's intention to return to <placeName type="island" key="#i_sn">San
                  Nicholas</placeName> for <rs><persName type="nativeamerican" key="#lw">the lost

                     >San Diego</placeName>, and no one could be found willing to risk a voyage to

            <p>It was generally known along the coast of <placeName type="state" key="#st_cal"

               <persName type="frontiersman" key="#gni">Captain Nidever</persName>, of <placeName

                     type="frontiersman" key="#tje">one other white man</persName></rs> and a small
               crew of <orgName type="nativeamericantribes" key="#natam_missionindians">Mission

                  schooner</name></rs> in search of otter. They made a landing at the eastern end of
                     <rs><placeName type="island" key="#i_sn">the island</placeName></rs>, and
               walked along the southern shore a distance of five miles or more. <span type="trope"
                  n="4"><persName type="frontiersman" key="#gni">Captain Nidever</persName>
                  discovered footprints of a human being soon after landing. These were no doubt
                  made when the ground had been soaked by the previous winter rains, for the
                  impressions were deep and quite dry and hard. The footprints were small, and
                        <rs><persName type="frontiersman" key="#gni">the captain</persName></rs>
                  felt convinced that they were made by a woman. A short distance from the shore
                  were found several circular, roofless huts made of brush, about six feet in height
                  and the same in diameter. These inclosures were fully a mile apart, and near them
                  were stakes of driftwood driven in the ground, from which were suspended pieces of
                  seal's blubber out of the reach of wild animals. The blubber was comparatively
                  fresh, and had no doubt been placed there but a few weeks previous.</span></p>

                  the day to search for seal and otter, but near noon a northwester began blowing,
                  and he hastened back to <rs><name type="ship" key="#sh_nidever">the

                  being at times so rough and the wind so fierce that he expected momentarily to be
                  driven from his anchorage. When the storm abated sufficiently, <persName

            <p><span type="trope" n="4"><rs><date when="1852">The next year</date></rs> he once more

                  landing near the same place as on his previous voyage. He and <rs><persName

                  to its western extremity. The blubber found on the previous visit had been
                  replaced by a fresh stock. In the crotch of a tree near the west end of
                        <rs><placeName type="island" key="#i_sn">the island</placeName></rs> they
                  found a basket containing a garment made of the skins of the cormorant, cut in
                  squares and neatly pieced together; with the ends of the feathers all pointing
                  downward.</span> There were shell hooks, bone needles, a rope of sinew, and
               various trinkets in the basket with the robe. These things <persName

                  her throat and arms were bare. Her hair was yellowed by the sun and tangled, and
                  her skin, where exposed, was brown, but where protected by her robe it was quite
                  fair, showing her to be of <orgName type="nativeamericantribes" key="#aztec"

                  spring from whence she drew her supply of water for cooking.</span> Here they
               found several unique water jars woven by her of the island grasses, and lined with
               asphaltum, which is plentiful on the western shore. The water jars resembled
               wide-mouthed bottles, and would hold from two to six quarts. It was interesting to
               watch her make baskets water tight. She would drop into them bits of asphaltum and
               hot pebbles, whirling them deftly as the asphaltum liquified. It required skill and
               patience,,<!--what do i do about this, double commas in the text--> but when they
               were thoroughly galvanized with a thin coating the jars were both light and
               durable.</p>
            <p>A second spring near the above-mentioned grotto she used as a lavatory, and would
               frequently visit it, for she was very cleanly in her habits.</p>

                     schooner</name></rs> was ready to depart, she was made to understand by signs
               that she was to go on board. She evidenced the pathetic struggle she had waged with
               want in the years of solitude by gathering together every fragment of food in her
               possession. In the crevices of rocks and in other spots secure from the depredations
               of the wild dogs which infested <placeName type="island" key="#i_sn">San
                  Nicholas</placeName> she had laid up stores of bones and other refuse in
               anticipation of some future "starvation time." These she insisted should be carried
               with her. Once on board and the firebrand she had b[r]ought burned to ashes, she
               clung closely to the stove, showing that she often suffered from cold, as well as
               hunger.</p>

                  gave her a most cordial affection. She was naturally intelligent and full of
                  resources, and soon learned to communicate with those about her. She told of her
