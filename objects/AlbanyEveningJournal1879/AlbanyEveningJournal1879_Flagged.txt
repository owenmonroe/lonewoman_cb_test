From the __org__San Francisco Chronicle. 

The romance of "Robinson Crusoe," woven so ingeniously by the imaginative __person__De Foe from the slender thread of fact afforded by the narrative of __person__Alexander Selkirk, who for over four years was sole human inhabitant of the lonely island of __place__Juan Fernandez, possesses a perennial interest. It appeals to the sympathies of the reader, and by the fascination of its style almost persuades him to accept it as veritable history. The story which we are about to relate, though true in every particular, possesses a remarkable similarity in many of its incidents to the tale told by __person__De Foe, and affords another illustration of the adage that "truth is stranger than fiction." In the __date__spring of 1835 the schooner __place__Peor es Nada, built at __place__Monterey, was chartered by __person__Lewis T. Burton and __person__Isaac J. Sparks for an otter-hunting expedition from __place__Santa Barbara to the __place__coast of Lower California. __place__The schooner sailed in __date__May, but the trip not proving so successful as was anticipated, she returned as far north as __place__San Pedro, where she remained at anchor during a portion of the month of __date__August of the same year. It being known that the __place__small island of San Nicholas, situated about seventy miles southwest of __place__San Pedro and a little further southeast from __place__Santa Barbara, was inhabited by a number of __org__Indians, the __place__Peor es Nada was despatched [dispatched] to remove them to the __place__main land. Nineteen men, women and children were taken on board __place__the schooner, which was preparing to depart, when __person__one of the Indian mothers discovered that two of her offspring had been forgotten and left on __place__the island. With true maternal devotion she sprang into the water and swam to the shore in search of the __person__missing children, one of which was three years of age and the other __person__an infant unable to walk. Her hurried search was unavailing, and, abandoning all hope of finding __person__the babes, she returned to the beach just in time to see __place__the schooner sailing away with all her friends on board. She called franticaly for some one to take her to __place__the vessel, but received no reply but one sad word, <emph>man yana</emph>(to morrow), which never after ceased to ring in her ear and was repeated on her dying bed.

__place__The schooner never went back to __place__the island, which was not again visited until __date__1851, when __person__George Nidever, another hunter, stopped there for a few days. He was not previously aware that the place was inhabited, but on this occasion he became convinced that such was the case. He noticed three small circular inclosures about 200 yards from teh beach and about a mile apart. They were about six feet in diameter, and made of brush, the walls five feet high, with a small opening on one side. Near these openings were sticks of drift wood stuck in the ground in the form of a tripod, supporting dried seal blubber. These inclosures appeared to be simply wind breaks, affording no protection from the rain. He also saw a mysterious footprint, and judged it to be that of a woman from its small size and arched centre. An approaching storm obliged __place__Nidever's vessel to leave __place__the island without allowing him to pursue his investigations any further.

__person__Mr. Nidever having seen many otter on his first trip to __place__the island, made a second druing the __date__winter of 1852, and being requested by the __org__Mission Fathers of Santa Barbara, he and __place__a party determined to make a careful hunt for the supposed __person__lone inhabitant of the island. Within half a mile of the head of __place__the island they discovered a basket in the crotch of a bush or small tree, covered with a sealskin, and containing a dress made of shag's skins&#8212;a sea fowl common in that section&#8212;carefully folded up, and several square pieces of skins similar to those of which the dress was made, also, a rope made of seal sinews, abalone shell fish-hooks, bone needles, etc. As it was late, and time for them to return to their boat for the night, __person__Mr. Nidever scattered the contents of the basket on the ground, so that upon his return he could judge of the presence or absence of __person__the owner by finding them gathered up or remaining as he left them. The following four or more days were spent in otter hunting, and before the search for the __person__Indian woman was renewed a southeast gale compelled them to seek a more hospital [hospitable] harbor at the island of __place__San Miguel.

A third expedition, made to __place__the island in __date__1853, by __person__Nidever, __person__Charles Brown and __person__four Indians from the __org__Santa Barbara Mission, was more successful. On the day after landing, __person__Mr. Brown discovered the object of their search at a distance, and cautiously approaching in an opposite direction from the __person__remainder of the party, got quite close to her without being observed. She was in one of her pens or wind breaks, clothed in a garment made of the skins of the shag, without sleeves, low-necked, and, as observed when standing up, extending almost to the ankles. She was sitting cross-legged, skinning seal blubber with a rude knife made of a piece of hoop iron driven into a piece of wood. There was no covering on her head excepting a thick mass of matted hair of a yellowish brown color, due to the exposure to the sun and air. The hair was short, looking as though the free ends had rotted off. She would occasionally raise her hand and shade her eyes and look toward the __person__other men on a sandy plain near the beach, whom she evidently saw. __person__The balance of the party were now signaled in order that she might be captured if she attampted to escape. To the surprise of all she made no attempt to get away, but greeted each one as they appraoched with a bow and a smile, and chattered all the time in a dialect none of them understood, although __person__the Indians accompanying __person__Mr. Nidever were acquainted with several Indian dialects. She was talking apparently to herself form the time __person__Mr. Brown approached in hearing distance until she was made aware of his presence. The expression of her face was pleasing, her features were regular, and her complexion much fairer and her form more symmetrical that that of the Indian women on the __place__main land; and she is believed to have belonged to a __org__different and superior race. By signs and other means of communication she was made aware that they wanted her to accompany them, and without any apparent hesitation she made ready to follow. In their course to where __place__the schooner lay at anchor they found a beautiful spring of water issuing from the bank above the beach, under a shelving rock. The cracks or fissures in the rock were stuck full of bones, and there were other evidences of an encampment of the __person__lone inhabitant of the island. These bones were used for nourishment obtained by sucking; they were dried and resucked many times, showing that occasionally she was put upon short rations, but at the time of her discovery appeared to have an abundance, such as it was. She retained all her teeth, but they were worn low, supposed to be due to her chewing tough and solid articles of food. Her age appeared to be about fifty years. __person__Mr. Brown made her a skirt of ticking, with which, and a sailor's cotton shirt and a black necktie, her dress was complete.

A severe storm arose, and embarking with their __person__Island Queen, __person__the men soon found themselves at sea in a storm. She made signs that she could stop the storm, and obtaining permission she knelt on the deck facing the quarter whence the wind came and commenced muttering something supposed to be a prayer. She soon got up, but continured the prayer at intervals during the day, apparently without fear, and when the wind began to abate she turned to her fellow-voyagers, and with a smile, made signs that her prayers had been answered. She was taken to the __place__house of Mr. Nidever, in __place__Santa Barbara, where she became the centre of attraction.

The __org__Mission Fathers took a great interest in her, sending to __place__Los Angeles and other places, hoping to find some one who could converse with her, but failed. Even the __org__Pepimaros Indians, who were said to have had an acquaintance with the __org__Indians on the island, could not understand her. Two offers, one of $1,000, for the privilage of taking her to __place__San Francisco, were refused by __person__Mr. Nidever. When found she was in excellent physical condition, strong and active, but the eating of fruit and vegetables brought on a sickness, which, in connection with an injury to the spine received by falling from a proch, terminated her life four weeks later, or seven weeks from the time she landed. Her dress of shag skins, basket and trinkets were given to __person__Father Gonzalez, of __org__the Mission, who, it is said, sent them to __place__Rome. Messrs. __person__Nidever and __person__Brown are still living, and it is on their authority that the foregoing strange narrative is given to the readers of the <emph>__org__Chronicle</emph>.
