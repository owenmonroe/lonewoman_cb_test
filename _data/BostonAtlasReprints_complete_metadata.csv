Off the coast of Alta California, about two degrees distant, bearing nearly west from Point San Pedro, which is in the latitude of 33 43 N., and longitude 118 14 W., will be found a small island, called by the [Spaniards] St. Nicholas. This island was formerly inhabited by an inoffensive, indolent race of Indians, who subsisted almost entirely upon fish, which they caught from the rocks, and muscles, which they found in the sands of the beach. They were a listless, quiet race of beings, who seldom had communication with others of the human family, and who had but few wants and fewer cares. About the year eighteen hundred and eighteen or twenty, the Russians, from their settlements at the North, landed on this island a party of Kodiac Indians, for the purpose of hunting the sea otter, which at that period, abounded in those waters. This party remained on the island for more than two years, and were the means of sowing the seeds of disease and contention amongst its unsuspecting and unsophisticated inhabitants. Some ten or twelve years after the departure of the Kodiacs, this tribe had become diminished to about twenty or thirty individuals, when the Governor of the department of California sent over a small vessel and removed them to the main. In the last boat which was embarking with the last of this people, (some six or eight perhaps in number,) to convey them to the vessel, which was to carry them from the home of their nativity forever, was one of the tribe, small in statute [stature], not far advanced in years, and his dusky mate, then in the bloom of life. The order had been given to shove from the shore; the oars had dipped in the wave; the boat was rising on the foaming surf, then breaking on the beach with awful roar, when with the impulse of the moment as it were, this young and blooming bride of the red man, the imprint of whose footstep had been the last left on the sands of her island home waved an adieu to her chosen mate, plunged into the abyss, ""strove through the surge,"" and, in another moment, stood alone on the shores of her native land. She turned, to give the last lingering look to her departing help-mate; and then gathering round her form the flowing mantle, wet by the ocean wave in an instant disappeared forever from the sight of her astonished and sorrowing companions. The vessel weighed anchor, spread her canvas; and in forty-eight hours, this remnant of the inhabitants of San Nicholas were landed on Point San Pedro, houseless and forlorn. From that period to the present&#8212;if she be not dead, or has not left within the past eighteen months&#8212;has resided alone, on the Isle of San Nicholas, this female Crusoe, the monarch of all she surveys. She preferred to part even with her chosen mate, and sever every human tie that could be binding, rather than leave the home of her birth&#8212;that lonely little Isle, that had been to her a world, which she cared not to exchange for the abode of civilized [man,] with all its promised luxuries. Since our Crusoe became the sole monarch of the Isle, San Nicholas has been visited perhaps ten or twelve different times, by different individuals; but there she has continued to be found, with none to dispute her right&#8212;alone[,] solitary and forsaken. Her dress, or covering, is composed of the skins of small birds, which she kills with stones, and sews them together with a needle of bone and the light sinews of the hair seal; sometimes found dead amongst the rocks. Her only food is a shell fish, of the muscles species, with now and then a still smaller fish. She never remains long in one spot; but is constantly wandering around the shores of the Island, sleeping, which she seldom does, in small caves and crevices in the rock. During the few last years, it has been very difficult to obtain any communication with her.&#8212;At the approach of the white man she flees, as from an evil spirit: and the only way to detain her is by running her down, as you would the wild goat of the mountain, or the young fawn of the plains. Those who have seen her at the latest period report that she appears to have lost all knowledge of language; that she makes only a wild noise, altogether inhuman; and, when taken and detained against her will, becomes frightened and restless; that the moment she is liberated she darts off, and endeavors to secret herself in the wild grass, or amongst the rocks which hang over the never ceasing surf. Every endeavor has been made, and every inducement offered, by different individuals, to prevail upon her to leave the island, but in vain.&#8212;The only home she appears to desire, is her own little isle. Her last hope, if she has any, is to finish her journey alone. She has no wish now to hear again the sweet music of speech. Its sounds are no longer music to her ear&#8212;and, as for civilized man, his tameness is shocking even to her dormant senses. To all appearance, she is strong, healthy, and content to be alone. What can reconcile her to her lot, who can conjecture? Humanity may hope that contentment may continue to be hers, to the last hour; for she is destined to lie down and die alone, on the cold shore of her isolated home, with no one to administer to her last wants, and none to cover her cold body, when the spirit shall have left the clay. But the story of our Crusoe's chosen mate, the companion of her early life, has yet to be told.&#8212;He saw her for the last time, as we have stated, when she stood alone on the shores of her Isle; when the boat with himself and his companions was dashing thro[u]gh the wild surf, and broke in uninterrupted succession against the rocks which encircled the resting place of his fathers, and which he was then leaving forever. When [With] the remnant of the family from San Nicholas, our hero was landed at [San] Pedro and there left, with the others who had accompanied him, to find a home in the land of strangers. San Pedro, it may be known, is a bleak, barren, bluff point, running out into the blue waters of the Pacific, on which no verdure is to be seen, and but one solitary abode of man, rising amid the desolation which surrounds it. The Pueblo de los Angelos is situated ten leagues distant, with one farm house between the one on the point and those of the town. The mission of San Gabriel lies yet farther on, some three or four leagues, where in that time, might be found, perhaps three or four hundred converted Indians. But our hero as he may be called, never left the beach on which he was first landed. Alone and friendless, there he remained, an isolated being, till life ceased to animate his frame. True it is that several times he was induced to venture as far as the Pueblo, and even the mission of San Gabriel; but he always, as soon as at liberty, returned and resumed his old station on the beach, or peak, or fixed himself on the rocks which hung around the point. And there he might always be seen, a solitary outcast, as it were, and more constantly when the sun was going down, with his eyes gazing on that celestial orb as it sunk [sic] into the western horizon, a direction which he well knew pointed to the lost but never forgotten home of his nativity. With difficulty he sustained the wants of nature by fishing about the rocks gathering muscles, and sometimes receiving a scanty pittance of corn from the house on the point, or a few pence from a passing stranger. He studiously avoided, as far as possible, all intercourse with his fellow men, and sought to live and die in solitude; and so did he continue to live a life which manifestly appeared a burthen to him, till one morning as the sun rose, not two years past, his body was found on the beach a stiffened corpse, stretched out, and bleaching as it were, in the white foam on the surf, which was thrown about his lifeless remains as the mighty wave broke on the shore. It is presumed his death was accidental&#8212;that whilst searching for shell fish in the night, amongst the cliffs, he must have fallen from an eminence, and thus terminated his solitary existence.",TheBostonAtlas1847_reprint,direct,EdgefieldAdvertiser1847/EdgefieldAdvertiser1847_DigSur_1.png,EdgefieldAdvertiser1847__TheBostonAtlas1847_reprint__direct,/objects/EdgefieldAdvertiser1847/EdgefieldAdvertiser1847_DigSur_1.png,multiple,compound_object

A Female Crusoe. Off the coast of Alta California, about two degrees distant, bearing nearly west from Point San Pedro, which is in the latitude of 33° 43' N., and longitude 118° 14' W., will be found a small island, called by the Spaniards Saint Nicholas. This island was formerly inhabited by an inoffensive, indolent race of Indians, who subsisted almost entirely upon fish, which they caught from the rocks, and muscles, which they found in the sands of the bench. They were a listless, quiet race of beings, who seldom had communication with others of the human family, and who had but few wants and fewer cares. About the year eighteen hundred and eighteen or twenty, the Russians, from their settlements on the North, landed on this island a party of Kodiac Indians, for the purpose of hunting the sea otter, which, at that period, abounded in those waters. This party remnined on the island for more than two years; and were the means of sowing the seeds of disease and contention amongst its unsuspecting and unsophisticated inhabitants. Some ten or twelve years after the departure of the Kodiacs, this tribe had become diminished to about twenty or thirty individuals, when the governor of the department of California sent over a small vessel and removed them to the main. In the lost boat, which was embarking with the last of this people, (some six or eight perhaps in number,) to convoy them to the vessel, which was to carry them from the home of their nativity forever, was one of the tribe, small in stature, not far advanced in years, and his dusky mate, then in the bloom of life. The order had been given to shove from the shore: the oars had dipped in the wave, the boat was rising on the foaming surf, then breaking on the beach with awful roar, when with the impulse of the moment as it were, this young and blooming bride of the red man, the imprint of whose footstep had been the last left on the sands of her island home, waived an adieu to her chosen mate, plunged into the abyss, ""strove through the surge,"" and, in another moment, stood alone on the shores of her native land. She turned, to give the last lingering look to her departing helpmate; and then, gathering round her form her flowing mantle, wet by the ocean wave, in an instant disappeared forever from the sight of her astonished and sorrowing companions. The vessel weighed anchor, spread her canvas; and, in forty-eight hours, this remnant of the inhabitants of San Nicholas were landed on Point San Pedro, houseless and forlorn. From that period to the present&#8212;if she be not dead, or has not left within the past eighteen months&#8212;has resided alone, on the Isle of San Nicholas, this female Crusoe, the monarch of all she surveys. She preferred to part even with her chosen mate, and sever every human tie that could be binding, rather than leave the home of her birth&#8212;that lonely little isle, that had been to her a world, which she cared not to exchange for the abode of civilized man, wilh all its promised luxuries. Since our Crusoe became the solo monarch of the isle, San Nicholas has been visited perhaps ten or twelve different times, by different individuals; but there she has continued to be found, with none to dispute her right&#8212;alone, solitary and forsaken. Her dress, or covering, is composed of the skins of small birds, which she kills with stones, and sews them together with a needle of bone and the light sinews of the hair seal, sometimes found dead among the rocks. Her only food is a shell-fish, of the muscle species, with now and then a still smaller fish, which the surf sometimes throws onto the bench. She never remains long in one spot; but is constantly wandering around the shores of the island, sleeping, which she seldom does, in small coves and crevices in the rocks. During the few last years, it has been very difiicult to obtain any communication with her. At the approach of the white man she flees, as from an evil spirit; and the only way to detain her, is by running her down, as you would the wild goat of the mountain, or the young fawn of the plains. Those who have seen her at the latest period, report that she appears to have lost all knowledge of language; that she makes only a wild noise, altogether inhuman; and, when taken and detained agninst her will, becomes frightened and restless; that the moment she is liberated, she darts off, and endeavours to then secrete herself in the wild grass, or amongst the rocks which hang over the never ceasing surf. Every endeavour has been made, and every inducement offered, by different individuals, to prevail upon her to leave the island, but in vain. The only home she appears to desire, is her own little isle. Her lost hope, if she has any, is, to finish her journey alone. She has no wish now, to hear again the sweet music of speech. Its sounds are no longer music to her ear&#8212;and, as for civilized man, his tameness is shocking even to her dormant senses. To all appearance, she is strong, healthy, and content to be alone. What can reconcile her to her lot, who can conjecture? Humanity may hope that contentment may continue to be hers, to the last hour; for she is destined to lie down and die alone, on the cold shore of her isolated home with no one to administer to her lost wants, and none to cover her cold body, when the spirit shall have left the clay. But the story of our Crusoe's chosen mate, the companion of her early life, has yet to be told. He saw her for the last time, as we have stated, when she stood alone on the shores of her own isle; when the boat with himself and his companions was dashing through the wild surf, that broke in uninterrupted succession against the rocks which encircled the resting-place of his fathers, and which he was then leaving forever. With the remnant of the family from San Nicholas, our hero was landed at San Pedro, and there left, with the others who had accompanied him, to find a home in that land of strangers. San Pedro, it may be known, is a bleak, barren, bluff point, running out into the blue waters of the Pacific, on which no verdure is to be seen, and but one solitary abode of man, rising amidst the desolation which surrounds it. The Pueblo de los Angelos is situated ten leagues distant, with one farm-house between the one on the point and those of the town. The mission of San Gabriel lies yet further on, some three or four leagues; where, at that time, might be found perhaps three or four hundred converted Indians. But our hero, as he may be called, never left the beach on which he wns first landed. Alone and friendless, there he remained, an isolated being, till life ceased to animate his frame. True it is, that several times he was induced, and once or twice forced, to venture as far as the Pueblo, and even the mission of San Gabriel; but he always, as soon as at liberty, returned and resumed his old station on the bench, or fixed himself on the rocks which hung around the Point. And there he might always be seen, a solitary outcast, as it were, and more constantly when the sun was going down, with his eyes gazing on that celestial orb as it sunk into the western horizon, a direction which he well knew pointed to the lost but never forgotten home of his nativity. With difficulty he sustained the wants of nature by fishing about the rocks, gathering muscles, and sometimes receiving a scanty pittance of corn from the house on the Point, or a few pence from a passing stranger. He studiously avoided, as far as possible, all intercourse with his fellow-man, and sought to live and die in solitude; and so die he continue to live a life which manifestly appeared a burthen to him, till one morning, as the sun rose, not two years past, his body was found on the bench a stiffened corse, stretched out, and bleaching, as it were, in the white foam of the surf, which was thrown about his lifeless remains as the mighty wave broke on the shore. It is presumed his death was accidental&#8212;that whilst searching for shell-fish, in the night, amongst the cliffs, he must have fallen from an eminence, and thus terminated his solitary existence.",TheBostonAtlas1847_reprint,direct,NewYorkDailyTribune1847/NewYorkDailyTribune1847_DigSur_1.png,NewYorkDailyTribune1847__TheBostonAtlas1847_reprint__direct,/objects/NewYorkDailyTribune1847/NewYorkDailyTribune1847_DigSur_1.png,multiple,compound_object

Off the coast of Alta California, about two degrees distant, bearing nearly west from Point San Pedro, which is in the latitude of 33 43 N., and longitude 118 14 W., will be found a small island, called by the Spaniards St. Nicholas. This island was formerly inhabited by an inoffensive, indolent race of Indians, who subsisted almost entirely upon fish, which they caught from the rocks, and muscles, which they found in the sands of the beach. They were a listless, quiet race of beings, who seldom had communication with others of the human family, and who had but few wants and fewer cares. About the year eighteen hundred and eighteen or twenty, the Russians, form their settlements at the North, landed on this island a party of Kodiac Indians, for the purpose of hunting the sea otter, which, at that period, abounded in those waters. This party remained on the island for more than two years; and were the means of sowing the seeds of disease and contention amongst its unsuspecting and unsophisticated inhabitants. Some ten or twelve years after the departure of the Kodiacs, this tribe had become diminished to about twenty or thirty individuals, when the Governor of the department of California sent over a small vessel and removed them to the main. In the last boat which was embarking with the last of this people, (some six or eight perhaps in number,) to convey them to the vessel, which was to carry them from the home of their nativity forever, was one of the tribe, small in stature, not far advanced in years, and his dusky mate, then in the bloom of life. The order had been given to shove from the shore; the oars had dipped in the wave; the boat was rising on the foaming surf, then breaking on the beach with awful roar, when, with the impulse of the moment as it were, this young and blooming bride of the red man, the imprint of whose footstep had been the last left on the sands of her island home, waved an adieu to her chosen mate, plunged into the abyss, ""strove through the surge,"" and, in another moment, stood alone on the shores of her native land. She turned, to give the last lingering look to her departing helpmate; and then, gathering round her form the flowing mantle, wet by the ocean wave, in an instant disappeared forever from the sight of her astonished and sorrowing companions. The vessel weighed anchor, spread her canvas, and in forty-eight hours, this remnant of the inhabitants of San Nicholas were landed on Point San Pedro, houseless and forlorn. From that period to the present(--) if she be not dead, or has not left within the past eighteen months(--)has resided alone, on the Isle of San Nicholas, this female Crusoe, the monarch of all surveys. She preferred to part even with her chosen mate and sever every human tie that could be binding, rather than leave the home of her birth(--)that lonely little Isle, that had been to her a world, which she cared not to exchange for the abode of civilized man, with all its promised luxuries. Since our Crusoe became the sole monarch of the Isle, San Nicholas has been visited perhaps ten or twelve different times, by different individuals; but there she has continued to be found, with none to dispute her right(--)alone, solitary and forsaken. Her dress, or covering, is composed of the skins of small birds, which she kills with stones, and sews them together with a needle of bone and the light sinews of the hair seal, sometimes found dead amongst the rocks. Her only food is a shell fish, of the muscle species, with now and then a still smaller fish, which the surf sometimes throws on the beach. She never remains long in one spot; but is constantly wandering around the shores of the Island, sleeping, which she seldom does in small caves and crevices in the rock. During the few last years, it has been very difficult to obtain and communication with her. At the approach of the white man she flees, as from an evil spirit; and the only way to detain her is by running her down, as you would the wild goat of the mountain, or the young fawn of the plains. Those who have seen her at the latest period report that she appears to have lost all knowledge of language; that she makes only a wild noise, altogether inhuman; and, when taken and detained against her will, becomes frightened and restless; that the moment she is liberated, she darts off, and endeavors to secrete herself in the wild grass, or amongst the rocks which hang over the never ceasing surf. Every endeavor has been made, and every inducement offered, by different individuals, to prevail upon her to leave the island, but in vain. The only home she appears to desire, is her own little isle. Her last hope, if she has any, it, to finish her journey alone. She has no wish now to hear again the sweet music of speech. Its sounds are no longer music in her ear(--)and, as for civilized man, his tameness is shocking even to her dormant senses. To all appearance, she is strong, healthy, and content to be alone. What can reconcile her to her lot, who can conjecture? Humanity may hope that contentment may continue to be hers, to the last hour; for she is destines to lie down and die alone, on the cold shore of her isolated home, with no one to administer to her last wants, and none to cover her cold body, when the spirit shall have left the clay. But the story of our Crusoe's chosen mate, the companion of her early life, has yet to be told. HE saw her for the last time, as we have stated, when she stood alone on the shores of her Isle; when the boat with himself and his companions was dashing through the wild surf, that broke in uninterrupted succession against the rocks which encircled the resting place of his fathers, and which he was then leaving forever. With the remnant of the family from San Nicholas, our hero was landed at Pedro, and there left, with the others who had accompanied him, to find a home in that land of strangers. San Pedro, it may be known, is a bleak, barren, bluff point, running out into the blue waters of the Pacific, on which no verdure is to be seen, and but one solitary abode of man, rising amid the desolation which surrounds it. The Pueblo de los Angelos is situ[at]ed ten leagues distant, with one farm house between the one on the point and those of the town. The mission of San Gabriel lies yet farther on, some three or four leagues, where, at that time, might be found perhaps, three or four hundred converted Indians. But our hero, as he may be called, never left the beach on which he was first landed. Alone and friendless, there he remained, an isolated being, till life ceased to animate his frame. True it is, that several times he was induced to venture as far as the Pueblo, and even the mission of San Gabriel; but he always, as soon as at liberty, returned and resumed his old station on the beach, or fixed himself on the rocks which hung around the point. And there he might always be seen, a solitary outcast as it were, and more constantly when the sun was going down, with his eyes gazing on that celestial orb as it sunk into the western horizon, a direction which he well knew pointed to the lost but never forgotten home of his nativity. With difficulty he sustained the wants of nature by fishing about the rocks, gathering muscles, and sometimes receiving a scanty pittance of corn from the house on the point, or a few pence from a passing stranger. He studiously avoided, as far as possible, all intercourse with his fellow men, and sought to live and die in solitude; and so did he continue to live a life which manifestly appeared to burthen him, till one morning, as the sun rose, not two years past, his body was found upon the beach a stiffened corpse, stretched out, and bleaching as it were, in the white foam on the surf, which was thrown about his lifeless remains as the might wave broke on the shore. It is presumed his death was accidental(--)that whilst searching for shell fish, in the night, amongst the cliffs, he must have fallen from an eminence, and thus terminated his solitary existence.",TheBostonAtlas1847_reprint,direct,PublicLedger1847/PublicLedger1847_DigSur_1.png,PublicLedger1847__TheBostonAtlas1847_reprint__direct,/objects/PublicLedger1847/PublicLedger1847_DigSur_1.png,multiple,compound_object

Hayden & Thos. M. Brewer,,,,,,,"The story of the Lone Woman’s isolation on San Nicolas Island was first published in a Boston newspaper, not a California one, and it appeared in 1847, years before the Nicoleña’s 1853 arrival in Santa Barbara. News of the Lone Woman’s island isolation was undoubtedly carried to New England by the Boston men who figured prominently in the Northwest and China trades. They likely heard the tale from fellow sailors while anchored in a California port, and they then brought the story home to New England. In fact, we can see the story travel from California to Boston in the journal of William Dane Phelps. A seaman born in Gloucester, MA, and living in Boston, Phelps kept elaborate journals at sea, in part for the entertainment of his wife (he sometimes sent journal pages home in advance of his return, by way of Boston-bound ships). In May of 1841, Phelps recorded the story of the Lone Woman and her people, which he had heard from another captain (Thomas Robbins) on the California coast. Phelps might not be the source for the Boston Atlas story, but his journal provides clues as to how the tale initially reached Boston.  
 

 Once the Lone Woman’s story was told in a Boston paper, it appeared in New York the next day (a copy of the Boston Atlas likely having traveled south by train). Within a month, the story had spread through the mails, reaching rural South Carolina by February and Wisconsin by March, for example. Simultaneously, it continued to circulate in New England and New York. Editors often held an interesting story in reserve, waiting for a column gap of the right length to insert the waiting copy. Seven months after the ""A Female Crusoe"" initially appeared in the Boston Atlas, the story of the Lone Woman ""doubled the horn"" a second time; a direct reprint of the article appeared in the Honolulu Polynesian, likely carried to Hawaii in a newspaper taken aboard a ship outbound on the Pacific trade.  
 

 The Boston Atlas article and its reprints is notable for linking the Lone Woman to Robinson Crusoe in its headline and for describing the Nicoleños as Noble Savages, a peaceful people who were taken off-guard by the arrival of Alaska Native hunters from Kodiak Island (which the article’s author erroneously dates to ""1818 or 1820"" rather than 1814). In the article’s telling, some years after the Alaska Native hunters leave the island, a ship is sent from the mainland to collect the remaining Nicoleños. The Lone Woman boards the ship but takes a dramatic dive off of it, leaving behind a bereaved mate who will pine for her on the mainland for years to come. The Lone Woman is described as voluntarily choosing to remain on her natal island, where she is an Indian Queen, ""the monarch of all she surveys."" She wears a birdskin dress and flees when she encounters any hunters.",,"A Female Crusoe. [Communicated for the Atlas.] Off the coast of Alta California, about two degrees distant, bearing nearly west from Point San Pedro, which is in the latitude of 33 43 N, and longitude 118 14 W., will be found a small island, called by the Spaniards St. Nicholas.

She turned, to give the last lingering look to her departing help-mate; and then, gathering round her form the flowing mantle, wet by the ocean wave, in an instant disappeared forever from the sight of her astonished and sorrowing companions. The vessel weighed anchor, spread her canvas, and in forty-eight hours, this remnant of the inhabitants of San Nicholas were landed on Point San Pedro, houseless and forlorn. From that period to the present&#8212;if she be not dead, or has not left within the past eighteen months&#8212;has resided alone, on the Isle of San Nicholas, this female Crusoe, the monarch of all she surveys. She preferred to part even with her chosen mate and sever every human tie that could be binding, rather than leave the home of her birth&#8212;that lonely little Isle, that had been to her a world, which she cared not to exchange for the abode of civilized man, with all its promised luxuries. Since our Crusoe became the sole monarch of the Isle, San Nicholas has been visited perhaps ten or twelve different times, by different individuals; but there she has continued to be found, with none to dispute her right&#8212;alone, solitary and forsaken. Her dress, or covering, is composed of the skins of small birds, which she kills with stones, and sews them together with a needle of bone and the light sinews of the hair seal, sometimes found dead amongst the rocks. Her only food is a shell fish, of the muscle species, with now and then a still smaller fish, which the surf sometimes throws on to the beach. She never remains long in one spot; but is constantly wandering around the shores of the Island, sleeping, which she seldom does in small caves and crevices in the rock. During the few last years, it has been very difficult to obtain any communication with her. At the approach of the white man she flees, as from an evil spirit; and the only way to detain her is by running her down, as you would the wild goat of the mountain, or the young fawn of the plains. Those who have seen her at the latest period report that she appears to have lost all knowledge of language; that she makes only a wild noise, altogether inhuman; and, when taken and detained against her will, becomes frightened and restless; that the moment she is liberated, she darts off, and endeavors to secrete herself in the wild grass, or amongst the rocks which hang over the never ceasing surf. Every endeavor has been made, and every inducement offered, by different individuals, to prevail upon her to leave the island, but in vain. The only home she appears to desire, is her own little isle. Her last hope, if she has any, it, to finish her journey alone. She has no wish now to hear again the sweet music of speech. Its sounds are no longer music in her ear&#8212;and, as for civilized man, his tameness is shocking even to her dormant senses. To all appearance, she is strong, healthy, and content to be alone. What can reconcile her to her lot, who can conjecture? Humanity may hope that contentment may continue to be hers, to the last hour; for she is destined to lie down and die alone, on the cold shore of her isolated home, with no one to administer to her last wants, and none to cover her cold body, when the spirit shall have left the clay. But the story of our Crusoe's chosen mate, the companion of her early life, has yet to be told. He saw her for the last time, as we have stated, when she stood alone on the shores of her own Isle; when the boat with himself and his companions was dashing through the wild surf, that broke in uninterrupted succession against the rocks which encircled the resting place of his fathers, and which he was then leaving forever. With the remnant of the family from San Nicholas, our hero was landed at San Pedro, and there left, with the others who had accompanied him, to find a home in that land of strangers. San Pedro, it may be known, is a bleak, barren, bluff point, running out into the blue waters of the Pacific, on which no verdure is to be seen, and but one solitary abode of man, rising amid the desolation which surrounds it. The Pueblo de los Angelos is situated ten leagues distant, with one farm house between the one on the point and those of the town. The mission of San Gabriel lies yet farther on, some three or four leagues, where, at that time, might be found perhaps, three or four hundred converted Indians. But our hero, as he may be called, never left the beach on which he was first landed. Alone and friendless, there he remained, an isolated being, till life ceased to animate his frame. True it is, that several times he was induced, and once or twice forced,to venture as far as the Pueblo, and even the mission of San Gabriel; but he always, as soon as at liberty, returned and resumed his old station on the beach, or fixed himself on the rocks which hung around the point. And there he might always be seen, a solitary outcast as it were, and more constantly when the sun was going down, with his eyes gazing on that celestial orb as it sunk into the western horizon, a direction which he well knew pointed to the lost but never forgotten home of his nativity. With difficulty he sustained the wants of nature by fishing about the rocks, gathering muscles, and sometimes receiving a scanty pittance of corn from the house on the Point, or a few pence from a passing stranger. He studiously avoided, as far as possible, all intercourse with his fellow men, and sought to live and die in solitude; and so did he continue to live a life which manifestly appeared a burthen to him, till one morning, as the sun rose, not two years past, his body was found upon the beach a stiffened corpse, stretched out, and bleaching as it were, in the white foam on the surf, which was thrown about his lifeless remains as the mighty wave broke on the shore. It is presumed his death was accidental&#8212;that whilst searching for shell fish, in the night, amongst the cliffs, he must have fallen from an eminence, and thus terminated his solitary existence.",TheBostonAtlas1847_reprint,original,TheBostonAtlas1847/TheBostonAtlas1847_DigSur_1.png,TheBostonAtlas1847__TheBostonAtlas1847_reprint__original,/objects/TheBostonAtlas1847/TheBostonAtlas1847_DigSur_1.png,multiple,compound_object

A Femole Crusoe. Off tho coast of Alta California, about two degrees distant, bearing nearly west from Point San Pedro, which is in tho latitude of 33° 43' N., and longitude 118° 14' W., will be found a small island, called by the Spaniards Nicholas. This island was formerly inhabited by an inoffensive, indolent race of Indians, who subsisted almost entirely upon fish, which they caught from the rocks, and muscles, which they found in the sands of the bench. They were a listless, quiet race of beings, who seldom had communication wilh others of the human family, and who had but few wants and fewer cares. About the year eighteen hundred and eighteen or twenty, the Russians, from their settlements on the North, landed on this island a party of Kodiac Indians, for the purpose of hunting the sea otter, which, at that period, abounded in those waters. This party remnined on the island for more than two years; and were the means of sowing the seeds of disease and contention amongst its unsuspecting and unsophisticated inhabitants. Some ten or twelve years after the departure of the Kodinas, this tribe had become diminished to about twenty or thirty individuals, when the governor of the department of California sent over a small vessel and removed them to the main. In the lost boat, which was embarking with the last of this people, (some six or eight perhaps in number,) to convoy them to the vessel, which was to carry them from the home of their nativity forever, was one of the tribe, small in stature, not far advanced in years, and his dusky mate, then in the bloom of life. The order had been given to shove from the shore: tha oars had dipped in the wave, the boat was rising on the foaming surf, then breaking on the beach with awful roar, when with the impulse of the moment as it were, this young and blooming bride of the red man, the imprint of whoso footstep had been the last left on the sands of her island home, waived an adieu to her chosen mate, plunged into the abyss, ""strove through the surge,"" and, in another moment, stood alone on the shores of her native land. She turned, to give the last lingering look to her departing helpmate; and then, gathering round her form her flowing mantle, wet by the ocean wave, in an instant disappeared forever from the sight of her astonished and sorrowing companions. The vessel weighed anchor, spread her canvas; and, in forty-eight hours, this remnant of the inhabitants of San Nicholas were landed on Point San Pedro, houseless and forlorn. From thnt period to the present(--)if she be not dead, or has not left within the past eighteen months(--)has resided alone, on the Isle of San Nicholas, this female Crusoe, the monarch of all she surveys. She preferred to part even with her chosen mate, and sever every human tie that could be binding, rather than leave the home of her birth(--)that lonely little isle, that had been to her a world, which she cared not to exchange for the abode of civilized man, wilh all its promised luxuries. Since our Crusoe became the solo monarch of the isle, San Nicholas has been visited perhaps ten or twelve different times, by different individuals; but there she has continued to be found, with none to dispute her right(--)alone, solitary and forsaken. Her dress, or covering, is composed of the skins of small birds, which she kills with stones, and sews them together with a needle of bone and the light sinews of the hair seal, sometimes found dead among the rocks. Her only food is a shell-fish, of the muscle species, with now and then a still smaller fish, which the surf sometimes throws onto the bench. She never remains long in one spot; but is constantly wandering around the shores of the island, sleeping, which she seldom does, in small coves and crevices in the rocks. During the few last years, it has been very difiicult to obtain any communication with her. At the approach of the white man she flees, as from an evil spirit; and the only way to detain her, is by running her down, as you would the wild goat of the mountain, or the young fawn of the plains. Those who have seen her at the latest period, report that she appears to have lost all knowledge of language; that she makes only a wild noise, altogether inhuman; and, when taken and detained agninst her will, becomes frightened nnd restless; that the moment she is liberated, she darts off, and endeavours to then secrete herself in the wild grass, or amongst the rocks which hang over the never ceasing surf. Every endeavour has been made, and every inducement offered, by different individuals, to prevail upon her to leave the island, but in vain. The only home she appears to desire, is her own little isle. Her lost hope, if she has any, is, to finish her journey alone. She has no wish now, to hear again the sweet music of speech. Its sounds are no longer music to her ear(--)and, as for civilized man, his tameness is shocking even to her dormant senses. To all appearance, she is strong, healthy, and content to be alone, What can reconcile her to her lot, who can conjecture? Humanity may hope that contentment may continue to be hers, to the last hour; for she is destined to lie down and die alone, on the cold shore of her isolated home with no one to administer to her lost wants, and none to cover her cold body, when the spirit shall have left the clay. But the story of our Crusoe's chosen mate, the companion of her early life, has yet to be told. He saW her for the last time, as we have stated, when she stood alone on the shores of her own isle; when the boat with himself and his companions was dashing through the wild surf, that broke in uninterrupted succession against thw rocks which encircled the resting-place of his fathers, and which he was then leaving forever. With the remnant of the family from San Nicholas, our hero was landed at San Pedro, and there left, with the others who had accompanied him, to find a home in that land of strangers. San Pedro, it may be known, is a bleak, barren, bluff point, running out into the blue waters of the Pacific, on which no verdure is to be seen, and but one solitary abode of man, rising amidst the desolation which surrounds it. The Pueblo de los Angelos is situated ten leagues distant, with one farm-house between the one on the point and those of the town. The mission of San Gabriel lies yet further on, some three or four leagues; where, at thattime, might be found perhaps three or four hundred converted Indians. But our hero, as he may be called, never left the beach on which he wns first landed. Alone and friendless, there he remained, an isolated being, till lifo ceased to animate his frame. True it is, that several times he was induced, and once or twice forced, to venture as far as the Pueblo, and even the mission of San Gabriel; but he always, as soon as at liberty, returned and resumed his old station on the bench, or fixed himself on the rocks which hung around the Point. And there he might always be seen, a solitary outcust, as it were, and more constantly when the sun was going down, with his eyes gazing on that celestial orb as it sunk into the western horizon, a direction which he well knew pointed to the lost but never forgotten home of his nativity. With difficulty he sustained the wants of nature by fishing about the rocks, gathering muscles, and sometimes receiving a scanty pittance of corn from the house on [the] Point, or a few pence from a passing strange[er]. He studiously avoided, as far as possible, all intercourse with his fellow-man, and sought to live and die in solitude; and so die he continue to live a life which manifestly appeared a burthen to him, till one morning, as the sun rose, not two years past, his body was found on the bench a stiffened corse, stretched out, and bleaching, as it were, in the white foam of the surf, which was thrown about his lifeless remains as the mighty wave broke on the shore. It is presumed his death was accidental(--) that whilst searching for shell-fish, in the night, amongst the cliffs, he must have fallen from an eminence, and thus terminated his solitary existence.",TheBostonAtlas1847_reprint,direct,TheFriend1847/TheFriend1847_DigSur_1.png,TheFriend1847__TheBostonAtlas1847_reprint__direct,/objects/TheFriend1847/TheFriend1847_DigSur_1.png,multiple,compound_object

OFF the coast of Alta California, about two degrees distant, bearing nearly west from Point San Pedro, which is in the latitude of 33 43' N., and longitude 118 14' W., will be found a small island, called by the Spaniards Saint Nicolas. This island was formerly inhabited by an inoffensive, indolent race of Indians, who subsisted almost entirely upon fish, which they caught from the rocks, and muscles, which they found in the sands of the beach. They were a listless, quiet race of beings, who seldom had communication with others of the human family, and who had but few wants and fewer cares. About the year eighteen hundred and eighteen or twenty, the Russians, from their settlements at the North, landed on this island a party of Kodiac Indians, for the purpose of hunting the sea otter, which, at that period, abounded in those waters. This party remained on the island for more than two years; and were the means of sowing the seeds of disease and contention amongst its unsuspecting and unsophisticated inhabitants. Some ten or twelve years after the departure of the Kodiacs, this tribe had become diminished to about twenty or thirty individuals, when the governor of the department of California sent over a small vessel and removed them to the main. In the last boat, which was embarking with the last of this people, (some six or eight perhaps in number,) to convey them to the vessel, which was to carry them from the home of their nativity forever, was one of the tribe, small in stature, not far advanced in years, and his dusky mate, then in the bloom of life. The order had been given to shore from shore; the oars had dipped in the wave, the boat was rising on the foaming surf, then breaking on the beach with awful roar, when with the impulse of the moment as it were, this young and blooming bride of the red man, the imprint of whose footstep had been the last left on the sands of her island home, waved an adieu to her chosen mate, plunged into the abyss, ""strove through the surge,"" and, in another moment, stood along on the shores and, in another moment, stood alone on the shored of her native land. She turned, to give the last lingering look to her departing helpmate; and then, gathering around her form her flowing mantle, wet by the ocean wave, in an instant disappeared forever from the sight of her astonished and sorrowing companions. The vessel weighed anchor, spread her canvass; and, in forty-eight hours, this remnant of the inhabitants of San Nicolas were landed on Point San Pedro, houseless and forlorn. From that period to the present(--)if she be not dead, or has not left within the past eighteen months(--)has resided alone, on the Isle of San Nicolas, this female Crusoe, the monarch of all she surveys. She preferred to part even with her chosen mate, and sever every human tie that could be binding, rather than leave the home of her birth(--)that lonely little isle, that had been to her a world, which she cared not to exchange for the abode of civilized man, with all its promised luxuries. Since our Crusoe became the sole monarch of the isle, San Nicholas has been visited perhaps ten or twelve different times, by different individuals; but there she has continued to be found, with none to dispute her right(--)alone, solitary and forsaken. Her dress, or covering, is composed of the skins of small birds, which she kills with stones, and sews them together with a needle of bone and the tight sinews of the hair seal, sometimes found dead amongst the rocks. Her only food is a shell fish, of the muscle species, with now and then a still smaller fish, which the surf sometimes throws on to the beach. She never remains long in one spot; but is constantly wandering around the shores of the island, sleeping, which she seldom does, in small caves and crevices in the rocks. During the few last years, it has been very difficult to obtain any communication with her. At the approach of the white man she flees, as from an evil spirit; and the only way to detain her, is by running her down, as you would the wild goat of the mountain, or the young fawn of the plains. Those who have seen her at the latest period, report that she appears to have lost all knowledge of language; that she makes only a wild noise, altogether inhuman; an, when taken and detained against her will, becomes frightened and restless; that the moment she is liberated, she darts off, and endeavors to secrete herself in the wild grass, or amongst the rocks which hang over the never ceasing surf. Every endeavor has been made, and every inducement offered, by different individuals, to prevail upon her to leave the island, but in vain. The only home she appears to desire, is her own little isle. Her last hope, if she has any, is, to finish her journey alone. She has no wish now, to hear again the sweet music of speech. Its sounds are no longer music to her ear(--)and, as for civilized man, his tameness is shocking even to her dormant senses. To all appearance, she is storing, healthy, and content to be alone.

He studiously avoided, as far as possible, all intercourse with his fellow men, and sought to live and die in solitude ; and so did he continue to live a life which manifestly appeared a burthen to him, till one morning, as the sun rose, not two years past, his body was found on the beach a stiffened cor[p]se, stretched out, and bleaching, as it were, in the white foam on the surf, which was thrown about his lifeless remains as the mighty wave broke on the shore. It is presumed his death was accidental&#8212;that whilst searching for shell fish, in the night, amongst the cliffs, he must have fallen from an eminence, and thus terminated his solitary existence.&#8212;Boston Atlas.",TheBostonAtlas1847_reprint,direct,ThePolynesian1847/ThePolynesian1847_DigSur_1.png,ThePolynesian1847__TheBostonAtlas1847_reprint__direct,/objects/ThePolynesian1847/ThePolynesian1847_DigSur_1.png,multiple,compound_object

This island was formerly inhabited by an inoffensive, indolent race of Indians, who subsisted almost entirely upon fish which they caught from the rocks, and muscles, which they found in the sands of the beach. They were a listless, quiet race of beings, who seldom had communication with others of the human family, and who had but few wants, and fewer cares. About the year 1818 or '20, the Russians from their settlements at the North, landed on this island a party of Kodiac Indians, for the purpose of hunting the sea otter, which at that period abounded in those waters. This party remained on the Island for more than two years; and were the means of sowing the seeds of disease and contention among its unsuspecting and unsophisticated inhabitants. Some ten or twelve years after the departure of the Kodiacs, this tribe had become diminished to about twenty or thirty individuals, when the Governor of California sent over a small vessel and removed them to the main land. In the last boat which was embarking with the last of this people, (some six or eight, perhaps in number) to convey them to the vessel, which was to convey them from the home of their nativity forever, was one of the tribe, small in stature, not far advanced in years, and his dusky mate, then in the bloom of life. The order has [had] been given to shove from the shore, the oars had dipped in the wave; the boat was rising on the foaming surf, then breaking on the beach with awful roar, when with the impulse of the moment, as it were, this young and blooming bride of the red man, the imprint of whose footsteps had been the last left on the sands of her island home, waved an adieu to her chosen mate, plunged into the abyss, ""strove through the surge,"" and in another moment, stood alone on the shores of her native land. She turned to give the last lingering look to her departing help mate, and then gathering round her form her flowing mantle, wet by the ocean wave, in an instant disappeared forever from the sight of her astonished and [sorrow]ing companions. The vessel weighed anchor, spread her canvas, and in forty-eight hours, this remnant of the inhabitants of San Nicholas, were landed on Point San Pedro, houseless and forlorn. From that period to the present&#8212;if she be not dead, or has not left within the past eighteen months&#8212;has resided alone on the Isle of San Nicholas, this female Crusoe, the monarch of all she surveys. She preferred to part even with her chosen mate, and sever every human tie that could be binding, rather than leave the home of her birth&#8212;a lonely little Isle, that had been to her a world, which she cared not to exchange for the abode of civilized men, with all its promised luxuries. Since our Crusoe became the sole monarch of the Isle, San Nicholas has been visited perhaps ten or twelve different times, by different individuals; but there she has continued to be found, with none to dispute her right, alone, solitary and forsaken. Her dress, or covering, is composed of the skins of small birds, which she killed with stones, and sews them together with a needle of bone, and the light sinews of the hair seal, sometimes found dead among the rocks. Her only food is a shell-fish, which the surf sometimes throws on the beach.&#8212;She never remains long in one spot; but is constantly wandering about the shores of the Island, sleeping, which she seldom does, in small caves and crevices in the rocks. During the few last years, it has been very difficult to obtain any communication with her. At the approach of the white man, she flees as from an evil spirit; and the only way to detain her is by running her down, as you would the wild goat of the mountain, or the young fawn of the plains. Those who have seen her at the latest period, report that she appears to have lost all knowledge of language, that she makes only a wild noise, altogether inhuman; and, when taken and detained against her will, becomes frightened and restless; that the moment she is liberated, she darts off, and endeavors to secrete [secreet] herself in the wild grass, or among the rocks which hang over the never ceasing surf. San Pedro, it may be known, is a bleak, barren bluff point, running out into the blue waters of the Pacific, on which no verdure is to be seen, and but one solitary abode of man, rising amid the desolation which surrounds it. The Pueblo de los Angelos is situated 3 leagues distant, with one farm house between the one on the point, and those of the town. The mission of San Gabriel lies yet farther on some three or four leagues, where, at that time, might be found perhaps three or four hundred converted Indians. But our hero, as he may be called, never left the beach on which he first landed. Alone and friendless there he remained, an isolated being, till life ceased to animate his frame. True it is, that several times he was induced,and once or twice forced to venture as far as the Pueblo, and even to the mission of San Gabriel, but he always as soon as at liberty, returned and resumed his old station, on the beach, or fixed himself on the rocks which hung around the point. And there he might always be seen, a solitary outcast, as it were, and more constantly when the sun was going down, with his eyes gazing on that celestial orb as it sunk [sic] into the western horizon, a direction which he well knew, pointed to the lost, but never forgotten home of his nativity. Every endeavor has been made, and every inducement offered, by different individuals to prevail on her to leave the Island, but in vain. The only home she appears to desire is her own little Isle. Her last hope, if she has any, is to finish her journey alone.&#8212;She has no wish, now, to hear the sweet music of speech. Its sounds are no longer music to her ear; and as for civilized man, his tameness is shocking even to her dormant senses. To all appearances, she is strong, healthy, and content [to] be alone.&#8212;What can reconcile her to her lot who can conjecture? Humanity may hope that contentment may continue to be hers to the last hour, for she is destined to lie down and die alone on the cold shore of her isolated home, with no one to administer to her last wants, and none [to cover her cold body, when the spirit] shall have left the clay. But the story of our Crusoe's chosen mate, [t]he companion of her early life, has yet to be told. He saw her for the last time, as we have stated, when she stood alone on the shore of her own isle; when the boat with himself and his companions was dashing through the wild surf, that broke in uninterrupted succession against the rocks which encircled the resting place of his fathers, and which he was then leaving forever. With the remnant of the family from San Nicholas, our hero was landed at San Pedro, and there left, with the others who had accompanied him to find a home in that land of strangers. With difficulty he sustained the wants of nature by fishing about the rocks, gathering muscles, and sometimes receiving a scanty pittance of corn from the house on the point, or a few pence from a passing stranger. He studiously avoided, if possible, all intercourse with his fellow men, and sought to live and die in solitude, and so did he continue to live a life which manifestly appeared a burden to him, till one morning, as the sun rose, not two years past, his body was found on the beach, a stiffened corpse, stretched out and bleaching, as it were, in the white foam on the surf, which was thrown about his lifeless remains, as the mighty wave broke on the shore. It is presumed his death was acci[dental that whilst searching for shell]fish in the night, among the cliffs, he must have fallen from an eminence and thus terminated his solitary existence.",TheBostonAtlas1847_reprint,direct,WisconsinHerald1847/WisconsinHerald1847_DigSur_1.png,WisconsinHerald1847__TheBostonAtlas1847_reprint__direct,/objects/WisconsinHerald1847/WisconsinHerald1847_DigSur_1.png,multiple,compound_object
